<h1>Multilingual-OCR-Application-Hindi-and-English</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
I developed a web-based prototype that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on uploaded images containing text in both Hindi and English. The application not only extracts text but also features a basic keyword search functionality, enabling users to efficiently locate specific information. I'm excited to share this innovative prototype, which showcases the capability to handle multilingual text recognition and search effectively
